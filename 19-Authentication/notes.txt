Authentication Pattern --> Statefull and Stateless.

eg Stateful .. Car Parking with adhaar card
   client gives username & password----
   server gives back uid
   now if client sends a req so server will authenticate it by checking uid

   how server gives us uid--cookies(ejs/ssr)--headers/tokens(RestAPI)
