🔹 REST Principles (Key Constraints)

Stateless — Each request is independent; no session data stored on the server.

Client–Server — Separation of frontend (client) and backend (server).

Uniform Interface — Standard structure for requests/responses.

Cacheable — Responses can be cached to improve speed.

Layered System — Intermediate layers (like proxies) can exist.
